# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

  about:
    first_p:
      Cindy Sauvain is from Switzerland and, at the age of 18, she got radically saved and received a call from the Lord to go
      and preach the gospel to the nations. Since her conversion, she has travelled across four continents preaching the gospel
      with signs, miracles and wonders following. After one year in full time ministry, Cindy has completed three years at the
      Bethel School of Supernatural Ministry in Redding California. She had the privilege of learning from the pastor Bill Johnson,
      Kris Vallotton and many others.

    second_p:
      She is travelling in Europe and around the world to equip churches to see heaven invading earth and see the Kingdom of God
      taking place. She moves powerfully in evangelism, prophecy and healing. She loves to lead people into a supernatural lifestyle.
      Cindy has a passion to see people fulfilling their destiny and understanding their identity as sons and daughters of God.
      Her ministry flows from intimacy with the Lord and she loves to impart this to the Body of Christ.

    first_text: Without you, nothing is possible ! Please, join me to see the Heaven come to earth.
    second_text: Paul, in Philippians 4:15-20, says clearly that his mission was made possible through the support of
      Philippians. It is through this partnership that the Gospel was announced. Become a partner allowing the supernatural
      of God to intervene and so have participation in each healing, each deliverance, and each person brought to salvation.
      Your gift, your support will make you a full partner. Thanks again !
